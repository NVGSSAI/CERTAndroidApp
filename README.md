15. Integrating the Database with IOS and WEB teams.
16. Initially, we have created a dummy data and tested that in all the three types of applications.
17. After successful testing, we have updated our application such that both Android and IOS applications look in a similar manner.
18. Finally, integrated all the 3 projects with original data.
19. Map functionality using Places API and Maps API
20. We have used places API for custom location.  Maps API to get automatic current location.
